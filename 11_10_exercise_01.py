"""Exercise 1

Write a function that reads the words in words.txt and stores them as keys in a dictionary.
It doesnâ€™t matter what the values are.
Then you can use the in operator as a fast way to check whether a string is in the dictionary.

If you did Exercise 10, you can compare the speed of this implementation
with the list in operator and the bisection search."""
