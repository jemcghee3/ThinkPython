"""The following example shows how to use concatenation (string addition) and a for loop to generate
an abecedarian series (that is, in alphabetical order). In Robert McCloskey’s book Make Way for Ducklings,
the names of the ducklings are Jack, Kack, Lack, Mack, Nack, Ouack, Pack, and Quack.
This loop outputs these names in order:

prefixes = 'JKLMNOPQ'
suffix = 'ack'

for letter in prefixes:
    print(letter + suffix)

The output is:

Jack
Kack
Lack
Mack
Nack
Oack
Pack
Qack

Of course, that’s not quite right because “Ouack” and “Quack” are misspelled.
As an exercise, modify the program to fix this error."""

prefixes = 'JKLMNOPQ'
suffix = 'ack'

for letter in prefixes:
    if letter == 'O' or letter == 'Q':
        letter = letter + 'u'
    print(letter + suffix)
